# parcel-transform-fable

The fable-compiler npm package is fable 2.13... this should be fable 3.

The fable-compiler-js looks promising... what are the current limitations? also how do you use it from node?

the fable 3 dotent tool doesn't seem to start a daemon, has its own watcher... how can that be integrated into parcel?
